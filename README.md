# rk4mrg
An explicit Runge-Kutta time-integrator for the full Maxey-Riley-Gatignol (MRG) equation. The details of the derivation and schemes is given in the paper <paper>.

Fortran codes used in the two numerical experiments namely, the oscillating-in-time flow (Section 6.1) and particle in 2D stationary Lamb-Oseen vortex (Section 6.2) are provided. In addition, the MATLAB code used in the experiment with the alternative embedding procedure (Section 6.3) too is shared.
