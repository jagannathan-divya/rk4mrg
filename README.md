This repository contains the codes used in the paper 'Explicit Runge-Kutta algorithm for non-local equations with memory effects: case of the Maxey-Riley-Gatignol equation' by Divya Jagannathan, Rama Govindarajan, and Vishal Vasan. See: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09714v1

Fortran codes (example1_rkxtd.f and example2_rkxtd.f) implementing Eq. 4.1 for 2-stage (Section 4.1) and 4-stage (Section 4.2) in the two numerical experiments namely, the oscillating-in-time flow (Section 6.1) and particle in 2D stationary Lamb-Oseen vortex (Section 6.2) are provided. In addition, MATLAB codes (example3_main.m and auxiliary .m functions) used in the experiment with the alternative embedding procedure (Section 6.3) too is shared.

Figures 2, 3, 4 correspond to Examples 1, 2, 3 respectively.
